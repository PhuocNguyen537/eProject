            "description": ["Cool and Circulate Air in Any Room. The Air King 9166 is used to circulate air in any room whether in a residential or work setting. The fan fits window openings that are between 27-inches and 38-inches wide and are 26.25 tall. Traditional window fans are held in place by closing the window down onto the fan. While this is effective, if you ever need to close the window, you have to physically remove the fan from the window. Air King's Storm Guard feature enables the window to be closed behind the fan during inclement weather, or when securing the home. This Air King Window Fan is made of an impact resistant plastic housing, powder coated steel front grill and blade. With a powerful motor, this fan is the perfect cooling solution for instant air circulation and cooling. This fan is compliant with OSHA and ETL. It comes with a 1-year limited warranty to protect against defects in materials and workmanship. ",
